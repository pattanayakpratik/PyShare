## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x** if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Install the dependencies (mainly for QR code generation):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

*(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, simply run: `pip install pyqrcode pypng`)*

## 🖥️ Usage

1. **Start PyShare:**
Open your terminal/command prompt in the `PyShare` folder and run:
```bash
python main.py

```


2. **Connect via Phone:**
* The terminal will display a URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8010`).
* A `qrcode.png` file is generated. **Scan it** with your phone to open the app.
* *Tip: You can also click the 📱 button in the web app to see the QR code.*


3. **Transfer Files:**
* **Phone → PC:** Drag and drop files into the **"Send to PC"** box. They will appear in `SharedFiles/From_Phone`.
* **PC → Phone:** Place files in `SharedFiles/From_PC`. They will appear in the "Files on PC" list instantly.


4. **Stop Server:**
* Click the **🛑 Disconnect Server** button on the web interface, or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.



## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Same Network:** Your PC and Phone must be connected to the **same WiFi network**.
* **Firewall:** If you cannot connect, ensure your PC's firewall allows Python to accept incoming connections on port `8010`.
